\defgroup dev_iface_multiple_analog Multiple Analog Sensor Interfaces

The interfaces present in this group are meant to be implemented by
devices that expose sensor that can be efficiently expressed as vector of
real numbers, so-called "analog" sensors.

For more information see the documentation of server, client and remapper devices that operate on these interfaces:

* yarp::dev::MultipleAnalogSensorsServer
* yarp::dev::MultipleAnalogSensorsClient
* yarp::dev::MultipleAnalogSensorsRemapper
